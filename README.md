• Created with Adobe Photoshop.

• Light gray color for text so they would also show up in dark mode.

• Text layers had transparent background layer and saved in PNG format.

• Each text header was cropped with the same canvas width (1555 pixels), making them responsive when uploaded into the README.

My name is Jean-Paul (JP) Ventura.

My background includes computational research in Astrophysics, Education, and more recently, Data Science. I am interested in using data to craft compelling narratives and to communicate them using my technical and non-technical skills. I spend my time reviewing topics in machine learning, learning about Data Science in the product domain, writing articles on medium about techniques of interest and teaching students about Statistics, Data Science, Python programming and SQL.

Throughout my career, I've found exploring data and using it to gain insight about products/systems and how to improve them is the most exciting aspect of Data Science.

Projects I am currently working on include:

* Engineering a deep learning model-based movie recommendation system.

Fun facts & other things:

:large_blue_circle: &nbsp; I love thought-provoking chats about space, Natural History, Art, Society, and Comedy.

:large_blue_circle: &nbsp; In my spare time, I learn piano, tend to my plants and animals and learn about ML!

:large_blue_circle: &nbsp; I have Russian Blue cat, Ghost and an indonesian blue-tongued skink, Formosa ("Fee-Fee").
